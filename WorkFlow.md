# WorkFlow

## Branching
- **Main Branch:** The `main` branch contains stable, production-ready code. All major releases are tagged here.
- **Development Branch:** The `develop` branch is used for integrating features before they are merged into `main`. 
- **Feature Branches:** Each new feature should be developed in its own branch, named `feature/[feature-name]`.
- **Bugfix Branches:** For fixing bugs, create a branch named `bugfix/[issue-number]`.
