# Technical Guide
Hello Welcome to OS technical guide, here we will explain in depth how this OS functions, and how things work.
The technical guide is created for all users and is a tool for future development.

Ideally every feature, component, and piece of knowledge required to understand the project should be documented in the Technical Guide.
