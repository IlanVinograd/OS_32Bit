# Stage 1 Bootloader Documentation
## Overview
This repository contains the code for a multi-stage bootloader, with Stage 1 being responsible for loading Stage 2 into memory. This bootloader runs in Real Mode on x86 architecture, and initializes segment registers, sets up the stack, and reads sectors from the disk.

In this document, you will find an in-depth explanation of each section of the code.

## Pre-Bootloader: System Power-On
When the power button is pressed, an electronic signal is sent to the motherboard.
The **Power Supply Unit (PSU)** then sends a signal called ```power_good``` to the **Basic Input Output System 
(BIOS)**. Upon receiving this signal, the BIOS begins the **POST** (Power-On Self-Test) process.

The BIOS executes INT 0x19 to search for a bootable device. If a bootable device is found, it loads the boot sector at the address ```0x7C00```.

Our bootloader's Stage 1 is designed to be loaded at ```0x7C00```.

## Stage 1 Bootloader Overview
The **Stage 1 Bootloader** is a 512-byte program that executes in Real Mode. It:

- Initializes system segment registers.
- Sets up the stack.
- Loads the second stage of the bootloader from the disk.
- Transfers control to Stage 2.

## Setting Up the Environment
```
[BITS 16]              ; We are working in 16-bit Real Mode
[org 0x7C00]           ; Origin address in memory (0x7C00)
```
- [BITS 16]: Tells the assembler we are working in 16-bit Real Mode.
- [org 0x7C00]: The bootloader starts execution at address 0x7C00, which is where the BIOS loads it into memory.

---

## Entry Point
```
start:                ; Start of execution
    jmp main          ; Jump to the main label
```
- start: This is where the execution begins.
- jmp main: This instruction jumps to the main label to skip any initial data and begin the core setup of the bootloader.

---

## Segment Register Setup
```
main:                 ; Start of the main routine
    cli               ; Disable interrupts
    mov ax, 0x7C0     ; Load AX with segment base (0x7C00 >> 4)
    mov ds, ax        ; Set Data Segment
    mov es, ax        ; Set Extra Segment
    mov fs, ax        ; Set FS
    mov gs, ax        ; Set GS
```
- cli: Clears interrupts to prevent interruptions during setup.
- mov ax, 0x7C0: Loads the value 0x7C0 into AX. This represents the segment base, as 0x7C00 is the physical address where the bootloader resides.
- mov ds, ax: Sets the Data Segment to point to 0x7C0, so memory access is properly aligned.
- mov es, fs, gs: Similarly sets the Extra, FS, and GS segments to 0x7C0.

---

## Stack Setup
```
    xor ax, ax          ; Clear AX register
    mov ss, ax          ; Set Stack Segment to 0
    mov sp, 0xFFFF      ; Set Stack Pointer to the highest address
    sti                 ; Enable interrupts
```
- xor ax, ax: Clears the AX register by XORing it with itself (sets it to 0).
- mov ss, ax: Sets the Stack Segment (SS) to 0, pointing the stack to the beginning of memory.
- mov sp, 0xFFFF: Sets the Stack Pointer (SP) to 0xFFFF, meaning the stack will start at the highest address in the current memory segment.
- sti: Re-enables interrupts after setup is complete.

## Loading Stage 2 Bootloader
```
    mov ah, 02h         ; BIOS Interrupt 13h, Function 02h: Read sectors from the disk
    mov al, 01h         ; Read 1 sector
    mov ch, 00h         ; Cylinder 0
    mov cl, 02h         ; Sector 2
    mov dh, 00h         ; Head 0
    mov dl, 80h         ; Primary hard disk
    mov bx, 0x0400      ; Offset for loading Stage 2
    int 13h             ; Call BIOS to load the sector
    jc disk_read_error  ; Jump to error handler if read fails
```
- mov ah, 02h: Calls BIOS function to read sectors from the disk.
- mov al, 01h: Requests to read 1 sector.
- mov ch, cl, dh, dl: Specifies the Cylinder, Sector, Head, and Disk (Cylinder 0, Sector 2, Head 0, Disk 0x80).
- mov bx, 0x0400: Specifies the memory location (0x0400) where Stage 2 will be loaded.
- int 13h: Executes the disk read command.
- jc disk_read_error: If the carry flag is set (error), the code jumps to the error handler.

---

## Error Handling
```
disk_read_error:
    int 18h             ; Attempt a boot from a different device
```
- disk_read_error: If the disk read fails, this routine attempts to boot from an alternative device using BIOS Interrupt 18h.

---

## Padding and Boot Signature
```
TIMES 510-($-$$) DB 0   ; Pad to 512 bytes
DW 0xAA55               ; Boot signature
```
- TIMES 510-($-$$) DB 0: Fills the remaining space with zeros, padding the bootloader to exactly 512 bytes (BIOS requirement).
- DW 0xAA55: This is the boot signature required by the BIOS to identify the bootloader.
